# Oversight
A game where you play as a stationary watchtower who must guess its way in searching for the troublemaker down below. Look at the hint to succeed and prevent the enemy from destroying you.

Game Design:
1. There would be divs, one would be the Watchtower at the upper side of the screen and the areas at the lower side of the screen.
2. The areas will be divided into 15 individual blocks that are clickable.
3. The computer will randomly select one of the fifteen to be the area where it chooses to hide the troublemaker.
4. Many event listeners will be placed seeing if the Watchtower selected the right location as to where the troublemaker is hiding.
5. If the troublemaker is found, the Watchtower wins, if the troublemaker is not found in three tries, he wins.
